Hello and welcome to blah blah [baad me likhunga]

So Let’s start from the internet, assuming every reader/listener belongs to the 21st century,
you all know the internet.

In case you used to live under a rock, the Internet is a worldwide connection of computers
with this connection they share information through different WEB pages available on World Wide Web(WWW)
Now since you are out from your cave you will observe there is much more available on the Web
other than just raw information. There is much more going on such as designs, logins, messaging,
cloud storage, games, and so on.

That’s where a Web developer’s job appears.
Building Websites, managing web servers and web databases are part of Web development.
The whole work of any web developer can be divided into two main streams:
1.  Frontend developer
2.  Backend developer
There is also the term “full-stack developer”, which refers to a person who can work with both.

## 1. Frontend Developer:
   
  A front-end developer is someone who works on the development of the front part of the Website, Duh.
  In this field, you may need to design things. This doesn’t mean that you aren’t good at art,
  You can not give this a try because artistic ability in web designers is beneficial but not strictly necessary.
  Luckily there are many rules which help you to design a good website.
  
  On the way to becoming a front-end developer, you must learn some languages in the following order;
  <a href="#html"> HTML </a>, <a href="#css"> CSS </a>, _bootstrap_, Vanilla <a href="#js"> JS </a> ,
  Further JS <a href="#fw">frameworks </a> and libraries.
  And there are some more tools that are not compulsory to learn but they make your work way too easy,
such as FIGMA.

So let’s talk about this one by one.

<h2 id="html"> HTML </h2>

  if you are using the internet for a long time you may remember old web pages made of white background,
  black text, and blue-purple links.it was in early versions of web pages when no CSS
  or any other designing languages were used to design Pages.
  Learning HTML is important because it provides elements of any webpage in any Basic level website.
  HTML makes the basic skeleton of any website.

<h2 id="css"> CSS </h2>

  Now when you have a basic website CSS helps you to add Fonts, Shapes, colors, and basic animations to your webpage.
  CSS is quite a wide language and working with vanilla CSS could be a pain in the ass.
  Tools such as FIGMA could help in knowing what you want and what you are going to code.
  But this is not how a modern website looks like just shapes and no dynamic designs or data. This is where the fun part begins.

<h2 id="js"> JS </h2>

  The magical language which enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
  and pretty much everything else.
  (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
  **JAVASCRIPT** not only adds some cool features and functionalities to your webpage but
  also its further developed frameworks and libraries can simplify JavaScript code, create dynamic web applications, and even native apps.

<h2 id="fw"> React JS </h2>
  This may be a framework of javascript but its scope is wider than websites and web applications.
  For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications;
  React 360 can be used to build virtual reality applications, and there are other possibilities besides.

## Tools
- **Text Editor:** VS Code, atom, sublime text
- **FIGMA:** From my personal experience I can tell you that FIGMA saves a lot of time.
             instead of directly designing a web page by coding and trying moving a text one by one pixel to see where it looks better,
             you can first design your page in FIGMA which a designing software like Adobe Illustrator
             and CorelDRAW but its feature to import CSS of your design makes it one of the popular tool in front end developers.
- **Version control system:** Git, GitHub
- **Developer Tools:** Chrome Dev Tools, Firefox Page Inspector, Microsoft Edge Developer Tools
